## [Product Recommendation System](https://github.com/Ariamestra/DataScience/blob/main/Products/Products.ipynb)
[Products Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfsoftworks/cosmetic-products/data)

This project is a text-based product recommendation system for beauty products. It utilizes Python, Pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn's TF-IDF Vectorizer to process product descriptions and calculate similarity scores between products. The cosine similarity measure is used to find the most textually similar products based on their descriptions. Users can enter a product ID, and the system will recommend the top 10 most similar products based on the content of their descriptions. The project demonstrates a practical application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in building a recommendation system.

## [Trending and Sentiment Analysis - Cosmetics](https://github.com/Ariamestra/DataScience/blob/main/Cosmetic/Cosmetic.ipynb)
[Cosmetic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jithinanievarghese/cosmetics-and-beauty-products-reviews-top-brands)

This project analyzes cosmetic product reviews from a popular online retail dataset. The dataset provides a good foundation for sentiment analysis and trend observation. The notebook utilizes the `pandas` library for data manipulation, `matplotlib` for visualizing trends, and `TextBlob` for conducting sentiment analysis. The visualize the average monthly rating trends and the sentiment expressed in review titles and texts. By applying sentiment analysis to the textual reviews, we want to understand the underlying emotions and opinions of customers towards the products. For anyone lookinginto consumer behavior analysis, this notebook offers an organized methodology for insightful data analysis.

## [Chatbot Lorelai: A Guide to Conversations about Gilmore Girls](https://github.com/Ariamestra/DataScience/blob/main/Chat/Chat.ipynb)

As a devoted fan of "Gilmore Girls," I developed a chatbot named Lorelai, drawing its knowledge from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmore_Girls) and the [Gilmore Girls Wiki on Fandom](https://gilmoregirls.fandom.com/wiki/Gilmore_Girls). This knowledge is in a text file, chatbot.txt, which serves as the chatbot's brain. Chatbot Lorelai is like having a chat with a friend who knows everything about "Gilmore Girls." It's powered by some cool coding magic that lets you talk about the show as if you were swapping stories over coffee at Luke's Diner. Just get it set up with a couple of techy tools (we're talking NLTK and scikit-learn), and you're all set to chat. Lorelai gets the hang of your "hellos," dishes out fun facts and insights with a bit of text wizardry, and keeps the banter going until you're ready to drop a "bye." It's a blast for any "Gilmore Girls" fan wanting to deep-dive into Stars Hollow trivia or anyone curious to see natural language processing in a fun, laid-back way.
