[Products Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfsoftworks/cosmetic-products/data)

This project is a text-based product recommendation system for beauty products. It utilizes Python, Pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn's TF-IDF Vectorizer to process product descriptions and calculate similarity scores between products. The cosine similarity measure is used to find the most textually similar products based on their descriptions. Users can enter a product ID, and the system will recommend the top 10 most similar products based on the content of their descriptions. The project demonstrates a practical application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in building a recommendation system.

This project analyzes cosmetic product reviews from a popular online retail dataset. The dataset provides a good foundation for sentiment analysis and trend observation. The notebook utilizes the `pandas` library for data manipulation, `matplotlib` for visualizing trends, and `TextBlob` for conducting sentiment analysis. The visualize the average monthly rating trends and the sentiment expressed in review titles and texts. By applying sentiment analysis to the textual reviews, we want to understand the underlying emotions and opinions of customers towards the products. For anyone lookinginto consumer behavior analysis, this notebook offers an organized methodology for insightful data analysis.
