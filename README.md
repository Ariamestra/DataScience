## Product Recommendation System
[Products Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfsoftworks/cosmetic-products/data)
This project is a text-based product recommendation system for beauty products. It utilizes Python, Pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn's TF-IDF Vectorizer to process product descriptions and calculate similarity scores between products. The cosine similarity measure is used to find the most textually similar products based on their descriptions. Users can enter a product ID, and the system will recommend the top 10 most similar products based on the content of their descriptions. The project demonstrates a practical application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in building a recommendation system.
