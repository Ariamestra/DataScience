Gilmore Girls

Gilmore Girls (styled onscreen as Gilmore girls) is an American comedy-drama television series created by Amy Sherman-Palladino and starring Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore) and Alexis Bledel (Rory Gilmore). The show debuted on October 5, 2000, on The WB and became a flagship series for the network. Gilmore Girls ran for seven seasons, the final season moving to The CW and ending its run on May 15, 2007.

Gilmore Girls received critical acclaim for its witty dialogue, cross-generational appeal, and effective mix of humor and drama. It was a success for The WB, peaking during season five as the network's second-most-popular show. The series has been in daily syndication since 2004, while a growing following has led to its status as a 2000s American cult classic. Since going off the air in 2007, Gilmore Girls has been cited in TV (The Book) and Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time.[1][2] It has also become one of the most watched shows on streaming platforms since it became available on Netflix in 2014 and reaired on The CW. In 2016, the original main cast and Amy Sherman-Palladino returned for the four-part miniseries revival Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.

This show follows the lives of a 32-year-old single mother Lorelai Gilmore and her intellectual teenage daughter Rory Gilmore. The two women have big ambitions they try desperately to achieve: Lorelai wants to own her own inn, while Rory wants to attend Harvard University. They also deal with Lorelai's appearance-obsessive and very wealthy parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore, who pay Rory's tuition at an exclusive private school in Hartford, Connecticut. In exchange, Rory and Lorelai have to come to Emily and Richard’s house for dinner every Friday night.

This sets up one of the show's primary, ongoing conflicts: the Gilmore family is forced to face their differences and complicated past, their interactions fueled by these weekly dinners together. The contrasting mother-daughter relationships of Emily/Lorelai and Lorelai/Rory become a defining theme of the show and a lens through which many of the female relationships are viewed.

Throughout the series, one of the main characters and Rory's best friend, Lane Kim's love life is followed in addition to those of Lorelai and Rory. As the daughter of Mrs. Kim, a very strict, religious, and protective Korean immigrant, Lane struggles to hide her love for rock music and other aspects of pop culture from her mother, including dating. While Mrs. Kim repeatedly tries to find Lane a future Korean husband who is medical school-bound, she dates Henry Cho, one of Rory's Chilton classmates. Lane also dates Dave Rygalski, the guitarist in Lane's secret band and Zach Van Gerbig, the lead singer of the same band whom she later marries.

Also followed is Sookie St. James, Lorelai's best friend and chef at the inn. Sookie ends up marrying and having children with Jackson, the inn's vegetable supplier. Over the course of the series, Sookie acts as Lorelai's business partner and confidant. The series also tracks Luke Danes, the local diner owner and later love interest of Lorelai. Luke supplies the coffee and continual stream of food, and on occasion butts heads with Sookie over their cooking. At times acting as a parental figure in Rory's life, he is present for many of the Gilmore Girls' major milestones.

The quirky townspeople of Stars Hollow are a constant presence. Along with series-long and season-long arcs, Gilmore Girls is also episodic in nature, with mini-plots within each episode – such as town festivals, issues at Lorelai's inn, or school projects of Rory's.

Season 1
Main article: Gilmore Girls (season 1)
Rory is accepted by Chilton, a private school that can help her get into Harvard. Because of the school's steep price tag, Lorelai talks to her wealthy parents, with whom she has not communicated for a long time.

Rory has a difficult time settling in at Chilton, struggling to meet the demands of private school and attracting the fury of classmate Paris Geller, her academic rival. She meets her first boyfriend, Dean, but the pair break up when Rory does not reciprocate his "I love you", instead saying she needs to think about it. Rory spends the remainder of the season saddened by her break up. After being romantically pursued by Rory's teacher, Max Medina, Lorelai decides with a conflicted heart to give the relationship a chance. This dynamic creates some tension between Lorelai and Rory, especially after Lorelai is seen kissing Max in Rory's school. Lorelai becomes frightened by her feelings for Max and breaks up with him. At the same time, Lorelai harbors a close friendship with local diner owner Luke Danes, and several people comment on their mutual attraction—but Lorelai is in denial and Luke does not act on it.

A Year in the Life
Main article: Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life
Nine years after the end of the original series, Netflix produced a Gilmore Girls revival miniseries. Rory is struggling in her journalism career and having a no-strings-attached, secret affair with Logan in London, while technically having a boyfriend named Paul that she often forgets about. While Logan is engaged to be married, the two of them cannot seem to stay apart. Lorelai and Luke live together but are still having communication problems. Richard has recently died of a heart attack, which causes tension between Lorelai and Emily, and they end up in joint therapy. Lorelai starts to question her life, so she travels to California with intentions to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, where she has an epiphany. She fixes the rift with Emily by recounting a happy story about Richard, and goes home to propose to Luke. Emily decides to sell the Gilmore mansion and move to Nantucket, where she starts working in a museum. After encouragement from Jess, Rory decides to write a book about her life called Gilmore Girls. After Luke and Lorelai marry, Rory informs Lorelai that she is pregnant.

The miniseries aired on Up TV and The CW in November 2020, partly because the latter network needed additional programming to fill its schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The show follows single mother Lorelai Gilmore (Graham) and her daughter, also named Lorelai - who prefers to go by Rory - (Bledel), living in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. This is a picturesque town filled with colorful characters, which is located approximately 30 minutes from Hartford, Connecticut. Ambition, education, and work constitute part of the series' central concerns, telling Lorelai's story from pregnant teen runaway and high school dropout to successful business woman who is a prominent part of the inn industry.

Rory's transition from public school to the prestigious Chilton is similarly followed, exploring her ambition to study at an Ivy League college and to become a foreign correspondent. The show's social commentary manifests most clearly in Lorelai's difficult relationship with her wealthy, appearance-obsessed parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore, and in the interactions between the students at Chilton, and later, Yale University.

Gilmore Girls is an American TV series created by Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband Daniel Palladino, starring Lauren Graham (Lorelai) and Alexis Bledel (Rory) as a mother and a daughter who are more friends than mother and daughter and who both dream of pursuing satisfaction in their love relationships and their careers. The show mixes the drama and comedy genres and presents a wide range of emotions, characters and situations. Although apparently the target audience seems the female genre, the series explores the male universe as well with the important characters of Luke (Scott Patterson), Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), Logan (Matt Czuchry), Christopher Hayden (David Sutcliffe), thus it has been appreciated also by male audiences.

The last episode of Gilmore Girls aired in the US on the 15th of May, 2007.

The series counts 7 produced seasons and a total of 153 aired episodes. Plus one unaired pilot where the characters of Sookie St. James and Dean Forester were played by different actors (Alex Borstein, who later played the harp player Drella and the Gilmores fashion consultant Celine, and Nathan Wetherington).

Other main cast members are Kelly Bishop (Emily Gilmore), Edward Herrmann (Richard Gilmore), Keiko Agena (Lane), Liza Weil (Paris), Melissa McCarthy (Sookie), Yanic Truesdale (Michel), Jared Padalecki (Dean), Emily Kuroda (Mrs. Kim), Sean Gunn (Kirk), Sally Struthers (Babette), Liz Torres (Miss Patty), Michael Winters (Taylor Doose), Todd Lowe (Zach), Matt Czuchry (Logan Huntzberger) Adam Brody (Dave Rygalski) and Sebastian Bach (Gil).

From season 1 to season 4 the show was shot and presented in the traditional TV format, while season 5, 6 and 7 were shot and aired in a Widescreen format. Except the pilot episode and a few other episodes in season 1, which were partly shot on location in Canada, the whole series was shot in Hollywood on set. The hills that can be seen in the background from time to time are nothing but those of Mount Hollywood.

The show used an overall homogeneous, real world, naturalistic visual style, although the later seasons have gotten darker and more theatrical - more rich also in set elements and decorations, especially in the Gilmore Mansion, to go with the larger scale format -, in season 6 and 7, the slightly different color palettes and the lighting mirrored the change of the series tones: Lorelai's house got redecorated and expanded, thus it showed a different kind of lighting, accompanied by brighter and more feminine tints. The overall look and feel though was definitely not so bright, as Lorelai and Rory's lives... This was stressed by emotional, dramatic scenes characterized by darker and gloomier lights and colors. Following creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's directives for the DVD release of the series, "Gilmore Girls" was published in the traditional 4:3 TV format - the 1.33: 1 aspect ratio - completely from season 1 to 7, also cutting on the use of the modern 5.1 surround audio format.

Pop and cultural references to go with a speedy exchange of witty, sometimes incomprehensible dialogues between every character, are what makes the style of "Gilmore Girls" unique though. Another feature that characterizes the style of the series is a specific taste for the old and retro in general: from TV shows, movies to music, from costumes and set decorations, there is a choice in things that don't exactly look like the world of today and the world the other comedy TV series usually depict.

The Palladinos made homage, with the quick dialogues, to the classic movie genre of black and white pictures where actors engaged in super-speedy conversations (a direct homage is depicted in the episode Say Something, but also visual gags recalling screwball comedies back from the 30s or even before (for instance, we unexpectedly learn that Rory has a thing for the old movies of the Marx Brothers; she organizes a Marx marathon with her friend Marty in a season 5 episode).

Lorelai likes the 80s movies (she shows some new millennium kids an old John Hughes movie with Molly Ringwald, "Pretty in Pink", in the episode Super Cool Party People and references many times the cult "Breakfast Club", by the same director) as much as those dreamy musicals from the 50s-60s (as in 'S Wonderful, 'S Marvelous where "Funny Face", starring Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire, is the movie Christopher screens privately for Lorelai on a farm's wall their first date together since High school).

The emblematic Luke-Lorelai-Chris triangle of the series is also subtly mirrored in the final scene of episode Introducing Lorelai Planetarium with the introduction of a sequence from the movie "The Philadelphia Story" which Luke watches on the hospital TV soon after he discovered Lorelai's instant marriage with Christopher, an event that contrasts his original plans, made at the 7th season's beginnings, to marry Lorelai while taking a flight to Maryland - which is a situation depicted similarly also in the above mentioned George Cukor film, also starring Katharine Hepburn, an actress Lauren Graham has often been compared to by critics and fans.

In contradiction to that old-vibe, from season 4 till the end, the distance between Lorelai and Rory caused by Rory's life in college and at her boyfriend's apartment has determined also a very modern style depicted through mobile and non-mobile phone-dialogue scenes between mother and daughter that have kept the bizarre and witty style they had when they still lived together and talked live. An over-the-top use of phones was shown in episodes where the characters kept driving their cars or other vehicles (like a bicycle in episode It's Just Like Riding a Bike) while calling each other, or when more than two (sometimes also four) characters entertained a conversation on the phone, with obvious comical results.

The seventh season's production was taken by David S. Rosenthal, who had already worked on "Gilmore Girls" the previous season with the original creators, the Palladinos, who left the production officially for differences with the CW network at the end of season six over issues about whether renewing their contracts or not. Off the record, it was said that the relationship between the Palladinos and Rosenthal was optimal on the sets. Rosenthal was also a writer previously in the series and he definitely was the best person who could replace the Palladinos. Although the production didn't mention anything about continuing the work on the series while the last episodes were being produced because it was almost sure they would have come back after the summer for a new season, the narrative arcs of the series during its last season were fully explored and the more the final episode was coming near, the more the writers and producers, including Lauren Graham who portrayed the character of Lorelai, felt the need to give the series a sense of closure no matter what.

The actual reasons behind the failure in the negotiations between the Warner Bros. production company, the CW network, the series producers and the series star names to produce an eighth further season of "Gilmore Girls" are many - the main was a money and salary issue -, all of them kind of surrounded by an aura of mystery. Thus, up until shortly before the produced series finale, it was unclear to many if the show would get another season. This fact had a great impact mainly on the fans but also the cast, who were kind of taken aback when they learned that they weren't gonna go back to working in the series by the end of the summer. Many fans, who were enraged by the unannounced cancellation, saw this finale as unsatisfying and - in worst cases - incomplete. Actually, all of this is the result of a particular feature that characterizes the episode final scenes and, for that matter, the whole series: the imaginativeness. Most people were left puzzled by it because the way the whole final sequence of season seven was written and directed leaves a major detail - Lorelai and Luke's future wedding plans - up to the audience's ability of interpretation (read the "Lorelai Gilmore's character profile" to have an insight on this matter).
